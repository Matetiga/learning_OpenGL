## Dependencies Used
- GLEW
- GLFW

These dependencies should be downloaded and stored on a Directory called "Dependencies" with two folders, respectively 

### Glew
- https://glew.sourceforge.net/
I used the 'Binaries Windows 32-bit and 64-bit' <br>
Store it in Dependencies/GLEW 

### GLFW 
- https://www.glfw.org/
The Version 3.4 was used for this project <br>
Include the folder 'include\' inside Dependencies/GLFW (and also the corresponding VisualStudio version folder)
- glfw3.lib was used
